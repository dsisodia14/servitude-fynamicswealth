    <b> When a privately held business collects money from the public and in turn gives them  shares in their company. The shares are then traded for the first time in the stock market. The process is called Initial Public Offering.</b>

<br>
    <h3>Why companies<span>  go public</span>?</h3>
</div>

Companies go public to raise money. It gives them financial capital, that they can use to clear off debts, improve the infrastructure, invest in research and development of new products, introduce new products and so on. Apart from that, the increased financial scrutiny during the process of going public will get them better debt rates when they are issuing it.
<br>
And if the company’s stocks are in demand, there is always scope for mergers and acquisitions. The terms of negotiations can be in stocks. The demand also attracts the company’s top talents as the company can offer stock options as reimbursement. The company gets credibility and visibility after it gets listed on the stock exchange.

<h3>Who are underwriters and <span>  what do they do?</span>?</h3>
</div>
Investment banks send a few representatives to the company who want to sell their shares to the public in the market for the very first time. They work out the complete process for them, to ensure successful entry into the market. The amount of risk the underwriter takes depends on how he is compensated. There are two ways of underwriting.
​<br>

<b> -> Bought deal –  </b>Here the underwriters buy all IPOs from the Company and they resell it to the investing public. The compensation is the difference in the selling and buying price. The entire risk of the IPO listing outcome is borne by the underwriters.<br>
<b> --> </b>Death benefits are generally income-tax-free to the beneficiary.
<br>
<b> --> </b>Death benefits may be estate-tax free if the policy is owned properly.
<br>
<b> --> </b>Cash values grow tax deferred during the insured’s lifetime.
<br>
<b> --> </b>Policy loans are income tax free.
<br>
<b> --> </b>A life insurance policy may be exchanged for another life insurance policy (or for an annuity) without incurring current taxation.

​
<br>
<b> Note: All of the above statements are generally true; however the tax benefits of life insurance have certain limitations which under the wrong set of circumstances can cause the tax benefits mentioned to be lost. Please discuss with your insurance and tax advisor.</b>
<br>



<b> -> </b>Many life insurance policies are exceptionally flexible in terms of adjusting to the policyholder’s needs. The death benefit may be decreased at any time and the premiums may be easily reduced, skipped or increased.
<br>
<b> -> </b>A cash value life insurance policy may be thought of as a tax-favored repository of easily accessible funds if the need arises; yet, the assets backing these funds are generally held in longer-term investments, thereby earning a higher return.
<br>
<br>
<b>Disadvantages of Life Insurance
</b> <br><br>
<b> -> </b>Policyholders forego some current expenditure to pay policy premiums. Moreover, life insurance is typically purchased for the benefit of others and usually only indirectly for the insured person.<br>
<b> -> </b>Cash surrender values are usually less than the premiums paid in the first several policy years and sometimes a policyowner may not recover the premiums paid if the policy is surrendered.<br>
<b> -> </b>The life insurance purchase decision and the positioning of the life insurance can be complex especially if the insurance is for estate planning, business situations or complex family situations.
​<br>
<b> -> </b>The life insurance acquisition process can be annoying and perplexing (e.g. Is the life insurance agent trustworthy? Is this the right product and carrier? How can medical underwriting be streamlined?).
